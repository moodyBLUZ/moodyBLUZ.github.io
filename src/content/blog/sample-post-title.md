## How to make a post

### Option 1

The author can edit their blog content here as Markdown that Astro can interpret. 

> Refer to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and this [Github repo](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/examples/blog/src/content/blog/markdown-style-guide.md) for help writing valid Markdown. 

> See `src/content/config.ts` for supported front matter types--the metadata between the fences (`---`) at the top of the source code.

### Option 2

Email a draft of your post to the developer and have them edit and commit on their behalf.

### Option 3

Collaborate with your developer. Visit the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/) to learn about organizing the Astro project.
