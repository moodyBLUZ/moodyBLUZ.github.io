Dylan knew he didn't need a fullstack web deployment to fullfill his wife, Alyssia's, wish to own her own cute little blog site. 

When it came to posts he knew something like Jekyll templates would be the answer, and with a little soul searching on the web and a call to his faithful companion ChatGPT, he settled on the fun and very React-esque, Astro, for his frontend framework. 

With that he set to work mastering this new framework and getting all of the functionality wired together. However soon things would take a turn, for he was soon to be faced to face with an old time enemy of his: Cascading Style Sheets, or otherwise known as... CSS!
